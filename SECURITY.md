# MoneyPulse Security Guidelines

## Overview

MoneyPulse is designed with security as a core principle. This document outlines the security measures implemented to protect user financial data and ensure compliance with Google Play Store policies.

## Security Features

### Data Encryption
- **Database Encryption**: SQLCipher with AES-256 encryption is used for all local database storage
- **Key Management**: Encryption keys are securely generated and stored in the Android Keystore system
- **Encrypted Preferences**: All app preferences are stored using EncryptedSharedPreferences
- **Memory Protection**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory when no longer needed

### Access Control
- **Biometric Authentication**: Optional fingerprint/face authentication for app access
- **Auto-Lock**: Configurable timeout that requires re-authentication after periods of inactivity
- **Secure Mode**: Hides financial data when app is backgrounded
- **Screen Capture Prevention**: Blocks screenshots and screen recording

### Input/Output Security
- **SMS Sanitization**: All incoming SMS data is sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- **Log Sanitization**: Sensitive data (amounts, account numbers) is masked in logs
- **Data Isolation**: All data is processed locally on-device with no external transmission

### Code Security
- **Obfuscation**: ProGuard with advanced dictionary-based obfuscation
- **Root Detection**: Runtime checks for rooted devices with appropriate warnings
- **Emulator Detection**: Prevents running in emulator environments (release builds only)
- **Certificate Pinning**: Network security configuration prevents man-in-the-middle attacks

## Privacy Protection

### User Data
- **On-Device Processing**: All SMS and transaction data is processed locally
- **No Analytics**: No analytics or tracking libraries are included
- **No Cloud Storage**: All data remains on the device, never uploaded
- **Data Extraction Prevention**: Custom rules prevent inclusion in backups

### Permission Usage
- **SMS Permissions**: Used solely to identify bank transaction messages
- **Minimum Permissions**: Only absolutely necessary permissions are requested
- **Clear Disclosure**: Detailed explanations before each permission request

## Google Play Store Compliance

### Policy Alignment
- **Data Safety Section**: Clear documentation of all data collected and its usage
- **Permission Declaration**: Proper explanation for all sensitive permissions
- **Children's Policy**: App is clearly marked as not designed for children

### Security Measures
- **Code Scanning**: Regular security scanning to identify vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular updates to all dependencies to patch security issues
- **Release Testing**: Comprehensive security testing before each release

## Best Practices for Users

### Recommended Settings
- **Enable Biometric Lock**: For maximum security, enable biometric authentication
- **Short Auto-Lock Timeout**: Set the auto-lock timeout to 1 minute
- **Enable Secure Mode**: Keep secure mode enabled to hide data when app is backgrounded
- **Block Screenshots**: Keep screenshot blocking enabled

### Device Security
- **Keep Device Updated**: Ensure your device has the latest security patches
- **Use Screen Lock**: Enable a secure lock screen on your device
- **Avoid Rooting**: Do not use the app on rooted devices
- **Install from Google Play**: Only install the app from the official Google Play Store

## Security Testing and Auditing

### Security Testing Procedures
- Static code analysis with Android Lint and security-focused rule sets
- Dynamic analysis using OWASP Mobile Top 10 checklist
- Regular security reviews of third-party libraries
- Penetration testing for each major release

### Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by sending an email to security@moneypulse.com. Please do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until we've had a chance to address them.
